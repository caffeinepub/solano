  "summary": "The diff implements all 10 requirements with high fidelity. Backend actor in main.mo covers products, cart, and orders with persistence. Frontend pages cover catalog, product detail, cart, checkout, order success, order history, and home page. Visual theme, logo, and hero banner are all implemented. No significant missing requirements were found, though truncation limits full verification of stable var persistence in the backend and the reverse-chronological order guarantee on the order history page.",
